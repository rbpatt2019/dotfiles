# dotfiles

Here be dragons!

All the files to get my system settings up and running.
After some frustrations of trying to maintain two separate branches for different OS,
I (think) I've succeeded in making these nearly cross platform.
In the few cases where this isn't true,
separate files will be maintained.
At the moment,
this is only necessary for syu (update commands obviously OS dependent)
and qmk (keyboard shortcuts obviously system dependent).
